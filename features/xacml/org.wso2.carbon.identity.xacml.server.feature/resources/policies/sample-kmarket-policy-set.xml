<PolicySet xmlns="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17"  PolicyCombiningAlgId="urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy-combining-algorithm:first-applicable" PolicySetId="sample-kmarket-policy-set" Version="1.0">
   <Description>This is sample-kmarket-policy-set policy set. You need to promote this policy to PDP policy store to try out. Also make sure policy reference ids could be retrieve via the policy finder module that has been configured. If default policy finder module is used, there reference policy must be stored in PAP policy store as active policies.  You need a PIP attribute finder module to retrieve some attributes that are defined in policy.  Sample PIP attribute finder module and sample requests to try this policy, can be found at here [1] https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/carbon/platform/branches/4.0.0/components/identity/org.wso2.carbon.identity.samples.entitlement.pip This is same sample that is available with Balana with few modifications [2] https://svn.wso2.org/repos/wso2/trunk/commons/balana/modules/balana-samples/kmarket-trading-sample</Description>
